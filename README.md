ðŸ“Œ Description

This repository explores relativistic dynamics and its role in the accelerated expansion of the universe. We propose an alternative explanation that does not require dark energy, focusing instead on the cyclic conversion between matter, energy, and temperature.
ðŸ”¬ Abstract
![Uploading relativistic_dynamics.pngâ€¦]()

Relativistic dynamics describes the behavior of matter and energy under the principles of special and general relativity.
This project investigates how cosmic acceleration can be understood as a result of the mass-energy-temperature cycle, without invoking exotic dark energy.
ðŸ”¹ Standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter (Î›CDM) Model

    The conventional Î›CDM model assumes that dark energy acts as a cosmological constant, driving the accelerated expansion.
    This model is widely accepted but lacks direct observational evidence for dark energy.

ðŸ”¹ Modified Friedmann Model

    We introduce friedmann_relativistic_dynamics, an alternative formulation of the Friedmann equation.
    This model includes an additional parameter (alpha) to account for deviations from the standard Î›CDM model.
    The hypothesis suggests that mass-energy conversion at relativistic velocities contributes to the observed acceleration of the universe.
